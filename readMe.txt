Hi,

This project was one I created from a larger game, made by small team which I managed. My
main focus was on player interactions with objects in the environment, which given its uitlity in
the games industry, is a skill I have prioritized in my studies.

Here is a demonstartion of what I have learned about player-object interactions,
I have built a small map filled with interactable objects (everything from drawbridges to wrecking balls).
All objects are instance customisable with relevant variables.
Everything was built using Unreal Engine 4.26.2 (this was limited due to University assignment specification)
I am currently working on recreating and improving this piece of work in UE 5.1.0,

To launch please find "\Portfolio\Unreal Engine Work\Portfolio EXE\Game.exe"
or if you have UE 4.26.2 installed "\Portfolio\Unreal Engine Work\UE4262 FILES\Game.uproject"
